CLASS :
     The class is at the core of Java.it defines the shape	and	nature of an object.
     Any concept you	wish to	implement in a Java	program	must be	encapsulated within a class.
     Perhaps the most important	thing to understand	about a	class is that it defines a new data type.
     Thus, a class is a	template for an	object,	and	an	object	is	an instance	of a class.
     Because an	object is an instance of a class, you will often see the two words object and instance used	interchangeably.
     When you define a class, you declare its exact	form and nature.
     While very simple classes may contain only	code or	only data, most	real-world classes contain both.As you will	see, a classâ€™ code defines the interface to	its data
     A class is	declared by	use	of the class keyword.The classes that have been used up to this	point are actually very	limited	examples of	its	complete form.
     Classes can (and usually do) get much more	complex.
